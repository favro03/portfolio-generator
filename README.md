## Description
The idea for this project is for the user to input a word and see some information about the word 
such as definition, frequency of use, synonyms, etc. The practical value of this project varies 
from getting a simple definition of a word to finding other words that rhymes with the word
originally entered. It is possible to, for example, enter the word "facetious" in order to find out
the definition and frequency of usage of the word and use said word to impress your collegues. To
make the projeect more fun, we decided to add a feature that searches for famous quotes related to
the user's input.
